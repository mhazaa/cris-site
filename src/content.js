	about: `
    Hello, my name is <span>Cristian Aguilar</span> and Iâ€™m a <span>3D modeler and generalist</span> focusing on <span>hard surface poly modeling</span> and <span>digital sculpting</span>. As a multidisciplinary visual artist, I developed a variety of skills including <span>character modeling</span>, <span>procedural digital landscape generation</span>, <span>lighting</span>, and <span>texturing</span>.
    <br><br>
    I have a passion for other artistic fields such as <span>photography</span>, <span>video production</span>, <span>sound design</span>, <span>digital illustration</span>, and <span>2D animation</span>. With the skills, knowledge, and training in visual art already developed, I continue to learn new mediums and techniques. I love <span>sound design</span> and am a <span>music hobbyist</span>, creating music and sounds for personal works as a self-taught artist. A big enthusiast of video games, my passion pushed me to pursue a career in 3D modeling and animation in the games industry.
